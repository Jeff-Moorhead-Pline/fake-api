This is a simple API implementation that is meant to provide an simple
sandbox for learning about tools that call REST APIs. For example, if
you wanted to learn the fetch API in JavaScript, you could write an
application that calls this API. By keeping the API light and the
responses simple, learning the libraries and frameworks themselves
becomes much easier because you don't have to worry about parsing
through complicated responses from more robust production-grade
APIs.
